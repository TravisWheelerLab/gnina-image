# gnina Docker Image

A Docker image that can be used to run [gnina](https://github.com/gnina/gnina).

## Description

This image attempts to make gnina a little easier to use, given that it has
quite a few dependencies and isn't the easiest thing in the world to build.

## Tooling

We use a GitHub Action to publish tagged versions of the container to Docker
Hub: <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images>.
